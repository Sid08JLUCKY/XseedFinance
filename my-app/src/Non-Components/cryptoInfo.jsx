      <h5 class="infoHead">What is Cryptocurrency?</h5>
      A cryptocurrency is information, code, or token that exists digitally
      generated through cryptographic means. It uses the decentralised system to
      record transactions and issue new units. An FD calculator can be used to
      determine the interest and the amount that it will accrue at the time of
      maturity. It is a simple-to-use tool available on the Xseed Finance
      Website.

      <h5 class="infoHead">What is an Cryptocurrency Tax Calculator? </h5>
      The government has proposed income tax rules for cryptocurrency transfer
      in Budget 2022. Any income earned from cryptocurrency transfer would be
      taxable at a 30% rate. Further, no deductions are allowed from the sale
      price of the cryptocurrency, except the cost of acquisition. Also, you
      cannot adjust the loss incurred from the transfer of cryptocurrency
      against income from any other heads. Such losses cannot be carried forward
      to the subsequent years to adjust the future income earned on crypto
      transactions.
