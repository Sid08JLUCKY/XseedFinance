      <h5 class="infoHead">What is Fixed Deposit?</h5>
      A fixed deposit is a type of term investment offered by several banks and
      NBFCs. These deposits typically offer a higher rate of interest, subject
      to certain terms and conditions. The amount you deposit in these deposits
      is locked for a predetermined period which can vary between 7 days and 10
      years. <br />
      An FD calculator can be used to determine the interest and the amount that
      it will accrue at the time of maturity. It is a simple-to-use tool
      available on the Xseed Finance Website.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h5 class="infoHead">How does FD Calculator work? </h5>
      There are two types of FD that you may avail of &#8209; simple interest FD
      and compound interest FD. Xseed Finance has calculators for both types of
      FD.
      <br />
      The fixed deposit calculator for simple interest FD uses the following
      formula &#8209;
      <br />
      <b>M = P + (P x r x t/100)</b>, where &#8209;
      <br />
      P is the principal amount that you deposit r is the rate of interest per
      annum t is the tenure in years
      <br />
      For example, if you deposit a sum of Rs. 1,00,000 for 5 years at 10%
      interest, the equation reads &#8209;
      <br />
      M= Rs. 1,00,000 + (1,00,000 x 10 x 5/100)
      <br />
      = Rs. 1,50,000
